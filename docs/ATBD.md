# Abstract

# Plain Language Summary

## Keywords: snow fractional cover, snow grain size, snow albedo

# 1 Version Description

This is Version 0.0 of the SBG VSWIR Fractional Cover algoirthms.

# 2 Introduction

# 3 Context/Background

## 3.1 Historical Perspective

The SBG VSWIR Fractional Cover algorithm will build off a long heritage of retrievals, utilizing and improving on algorithms established for use with AVIRIS, AVIRIS-NG, and especially EMIT.

## 4.1 Fractional Cover Algorithm

### 4.1.1 Scientific theory

### 4.1.1.1 Scientific theory assumptions

### 4.1.2 Mathematical theory

### 4.2.1.1 Scientific theory assumptions

## 4.3 Algorithm Input Variables

Inputs to the SBG-VSWIR fractional cover algorithm will come from the L2A Reflectance product.
The core inputs are:

- **Surface Reflectance** The hemispherical-directional reflectance factor, or HDRF, except over water surfaces, where it is assumed to be the water leaving reflectance.
- **Surface Reflectance Uncertainty**:  The model-based estimate of the posterior uncertainty covariance from the reflectance

## 4.4 Algorithm Output Variables

- **Surface Fractional Cover**: The proportion of each pixel that is represented by the target class.  There will be 8 classes:
-- Photosynthetic Vegetation
-- Non-photosynthetic Vegetation
-- Bare Surface
-- Water
-- Snow
-- Ice
-- Char
-- Cloud

- **Surface Fractional Cover Uncertainty**: The model-predicted uncertainty in the fraction of each of the classes noted above, taking into account the uncertainty of the surface reflectance as well as uncertainties within the fractional cover model.
